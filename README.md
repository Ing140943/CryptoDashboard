# Crypto Dashboard by Next.js

## Intro
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) which is my first time to implement it. This web application was inspired by [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/). This web application represnt 100 of cryptocurrency in the world. I represent the symbol, how it changes in 24 hours, the real time price, the all time high of that currency and their marketcap. I use api form [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com) as my base information. Hope you enjoy with my first Next.js web application. 

### URL

[CRYPTO DASHBOARD](https://cyt-dashboard.herokuapp.com/)

## Getting Started


First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
